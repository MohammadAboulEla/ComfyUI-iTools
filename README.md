### **iTools Paint Node:**  

The iTools Paint node is currently in beta and functions as a standalone project. It may be the most complex node in ComfyUI, and future updates could break its functionality. However, I will strive to keep it working. All custom widget code was built from scratch specifically for ComfyUI and this node. It supports painting, compositing, remove background, text editing, and pasting images from the clipboard, making it the fastest mini Photoshop for ComfyUI.  

Compositing Example

### **iTools Image Loader Plus:**

is an enhancement of the original ComfyUI ImageLoader node. It attempts to return the possible prompt used to create an image. If the prompt isn't found directly, this node will search for the prompt within the following supported nodes in the workflow:

  - `CLIPTextEncodeSDXL`
  - `CLIPTextEncode`
  - `easy positive`
  - `easy showAnything`
  - `ShowText|pysssss`
  - `Eff. Loader SDXL`
  - `SDXLPromptStyler`
  - `iToolsPromptStyler`
  - `iToolsPromptStylerExtra`

If your prompt is within any of these nodes, you will be able to retrieve it. The `ShowText|pysssss` node is a convenient addition that you can integrate it into any workflow to make sure it will be retrieved by `iTools ImageLoaderPlus`.

### **iTools Prompt Styler üñåÔ∏è:**

Helps you quickly populate your {prompt} using a template name stored in a yaml file. I chose yaml over json because it will be easier for the user to read, edit it or to add his own templates, it will load all yaml files in the styles folder, so you may add your unlimited files there and easily add your own templates.
